          Introducing GigEngine, a three-month school assignment undertaken by groups of three, aimed at crafting a functional engine and leveraging it to create a demo game. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This project embraces a modern approach, incorporating essential features such as a Scene Graph with Quaternions, In-Game UI, Skeletal Animation, Scripting in Lua, Serialization, Physics with Bullet, and an Editor powered by ImGui. GigEngine aims to provide valuable insights into engine architecture and design decisions, making it an invaluable resource for aspiring developers.

          Makes Racing Great Again
        </h2>
        <p>
          Makes Racing Great Again is a racing game developed in Unreal Engine 5. This game was a collaboration between programmers and artists to create a fun and engaging experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game's objective was to be a modified version of Mario Kart. The game has a distinct track design and a wide range of power-ups. We are working on multiplayer support, and there is AI that may be played against as well. The game is still in development and will be released soon. You can check out the game on <a href=" https://github.com/Angel-2180/Make-Racing-Great-Again">GitHub</a>.

        Tricolor is a 4 days GameJam game developed in Unity. This game was based on the theme of 1 billion consumers.
      </p>
      <p>
        We wanted to make a game about garbage collection and recycling based on the theme of 1 billion consumers. With that idea in mind we settled for an experience where you take the roles of a garbage collector in a recycling center where all hell break loose with the massive influx of garbage that are to be sorted and recycled.

        LibMaths is a project that I started to learn more about Mathematics and how to make a library as well as helping in my other projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project is a library to see the functionality of Quaternion and Matrix and Vectors as well as somes utils. You can check out the Lib on <a href="https://github.com/Angel-2180/LibMaths">GitHub</a>

        Armadillo Engine
      </h2>
      <p>
        Armadillo Engine is a 3D Graphics Engine developed in C++ using OpenGL. It was developed as a project to learn more about graphics programming and specifically about Lighting shaders.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Engine support a wide range of features such as Phong Lighting, Gouraud Shading, Blinn-Phong Lighting, Assimp Loading, and a lot more. You can check out the engine on <a href="https://github.com/Hezaerd/Armadillo-Engine">GitHub</a>

      <p>
        Modern OpenGL Sandbox is a project that I started to learn more about OpenGL and how to make a game engine from scratch.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project is a Sandbox to see the functionality of OpenGL and Model Loading using my own Obj parser. You can check out the engine on <a href="https://github.com/Angel-2180/ModernOpenGL">GitHub</a>

      <p>
        PortalGL is a group project to recreate a Portal Like game using OpenGL and Bullet Physics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The requirements were to make a game that uses OpenGL and Bullet Physics. The game would need to incorporate the mechanic of the portal from the game Portal, have 3d audio physics and be made in 3 weeks from the project ModernOpenGL. You can check out the Game on <a href="https://github.com/Angel-2180/PortalGL">GitHub</a> (be aware that the project has multiple bugs).
