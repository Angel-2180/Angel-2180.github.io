                <p>
                    I'm currently employed as a 3D graphics and shader programmer in the media and advertisement branch, but I'm always open for new and interesting oppertunities in the computer graphics and game industry. My specializational interests include: game engine programming (both high and low level), computer graphics, gameplay programming and tool development.
