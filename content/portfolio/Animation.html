        This project was a small project to test out skeletal animation in OpenGL. The project was made in 2 weeks and was a solo project. The project use a custom engine named WhiteBox it was quite fun to learn Animation in C++ . You can check out the project on <a href="content/portfolio/PortalGL.html">GitHub</a>

      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Skeletal Animation</li>
        <li>Mesh Skinning</li>
        <li>Mathematics library</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For this one I had a huge bug where the Mesh would implode mid animation because of inverse matrix (the Whitebox engine need matrix for the mesh skinning so i had to addapt my Quaternion in the lib to create and read matrix)
