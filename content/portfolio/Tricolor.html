    <h1>Tricolor</h1>
    <p>Tricolor is a 4 days GameJam game developed in Unity. This game was based on the theme of 1 billion consumers.</p>
    <p>We wanted to make a game about garbage collection and recycling based on the theme of 1 billion consumers. With that idea in mind we settled for an experience where you take the roles of a garbage collector in a recycling center where all hell break loose with the massive influx of garbage that are to be sorted and recycled. You can check out the game on <a href="https://github.com/Angel-2180/TriColor">GitHub</a></p>
