        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Armadillo Engine is a 3D Graphics Engine developed in C++ using OpenGL. It was developed as a project to learn more about graphics programming and specifically about Lighting shaders.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Engine support a wide range of features such as Phong Lighting, Gouraud Shading, Blinn-Phong Lighting, Assimp Loading, and a lot more. You can check out the engine on <a href="https://github.com/Hezaerd/Armadillo-Engine">GitHub</a>
