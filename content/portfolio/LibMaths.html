      <h2>Introduction</h2>  
      <p>
        LibMaths is a project that I started to learn more about Mathematics and how to make a library as well as helping in my other projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project is a library to see the functionality of Quaternion and Matrix and Vectors as well as somes utils. You can check out the Lib on <a href="https://github.com/Angel-2180/LibMaths">GitHub</a>

      <h2>Additional Info</h2>
      <p>
        This lib is based and tested to follow the GLM library and is used in my other projects. The lib is still in development and will be updated as I learn more about Mathematics and interesting features to add.
