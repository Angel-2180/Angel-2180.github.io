      <h2>Introduction</h2>  
      <p>
        PortalGL is a group project to recreate a Portal Like game using OpenGL and Bullet Physics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The requirements were to make a game that uses OpenGL and Bullet Physics. The game would need to incorporate the mechanic of the portal from the game Portal, have 3d audio physics and be made in 3 weeks from the project ModernOpenGL. You can check out the Game on <a href="https://github.com/Angel-2180/PortalGL">GitHub</a> (be aware that the project has multiple bugs).

      <h2>My Contribution</h2>
      <p>
        My main contribution to the project was the implementation of the Bullet Physics as well as the ModernOpenGL Renderer. I also worked as Project Manager and was responsible for the overall project management and the integration of the different parts of the project.
