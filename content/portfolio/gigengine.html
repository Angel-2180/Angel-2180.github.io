        GigEngine is a three-month school assignment undertaken by groups of three, aimed at crafting a functional engine and leveraging it to create a demo game. This project embraces a modern approach, incorporating essential features such as a Scene Graph with Quaternions for efficient spatial representation, In-Game UI for immersive user interaction in both ScreenSpace and WorldSpace environments, and Skeletal Animation for lifelike character movements.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, GigEngine incorporates scripting capabilities through Lua, enabling flexible and dynamic behavior within the game world. Serialization functionality ensures seamless data storage and retrieval, while the integration of the Bullet physics engine enables realistic interactions and simulations. An intuitive Editor powered by ImGui empowers developers with tools for streamlined content creation and manipulation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although ongoing, GigEngine already encompasses various advanced features akin to professional-grade graphics engines, including Shadow Mapping for enhanced visual fidelity. With an emphasis on clarity, performance, and comprehensibility, GigEngine's codebase aims to provide valuable insights into engine architecture and design decisions, making it an invaluable resource for aspiring developers.
    </p>
    <p>
        While GigEngine continues to evolve, most of its feature set is readily available for exploration on its GitHub repository, inviting enthusiasts and learners alike to delve into the intricacies of graphics engine development.
