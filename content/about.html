                Hi, seeing as you may or may not have reached this page by your own intent I'm probably obliged to tell you a bit more about myself.
            </p>
            
            <p>   
                My name is Angel Gimer, and as the title of this page suggests, I am a major fan of computer engineering and game development. I managed to obtain an Attestation of College Studies in Engine Programming from Isart Digital. Unofficially, when the streets go dark, you'll often find me working with low-level gaming and graphics technology, as well as brushing up on current and emerging abilities in these domains. Like most individuals in both professions, I appreciate video games and films as art forms: great compositions of story, images, music, and effects, and I hope to play an important role in that in the future.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now that I've graduated, I'm actively looking for new possibilities. Despite having no professional experience, I created this website to showcase my engine and game programming portfolio. I'm excited to explore new options and see where this journey takes me. If you have any more questions, please contact me via the contact  <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="MenuClick($('#menu-contact'))">contact</a> page.
