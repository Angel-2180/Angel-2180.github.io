            <p>
                Hi, seeing as you may or may not have reached this page by your own intent I'm probably obliged to tell you a bit more about myself.
            </p>
            
            <p>   
                My name is Joey de Vries and as the title of this page suggests I'm a huge enthusiast when it comes to computer graphics and game development. My official papers suggest I've managed to secure a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, together with a master specialization degree in Computer Security. Unofficially, when the streets go dark, you'll often see me tinkering on low-level game and graphics tech and/or brush up on current and new skills in these respective fields. Like most people in these fields, I love video games and films as the art form that they are: a brilliant composition of story, visuals, music, fx and I'd love to play a significant role in that in future endeavors.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now, together with several years of actual industry experience, I've created this website to advertise my graphics and game programming portfolio to see in whatever exciting and new direction this might take me. Hit me up at the  <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="MenuClick($(&#39;#menu-contact&#39;))">contact</a> page if you'd like to continue our as of now one-sided conversation.
            </p>
