            Hi, seeing as you may or may not have reached this page by your own intent I'm probably obliged to tell you a bit more about myself.
        </p>
        
        <p>   
            My name is Angel Gimer, and as this page's title implies, I have a strong passion for both game development and computer engineering. Isart Digital granted me an Attestation of College Studies in Engine Programming. Unofficially, you can usually find me dabbling in low-end gaming and graphics technology after hours, or brushing up on new and developing skills in these areas. Like the majority of people in both fields, I value movies and video games as artistic mediums because they are masterful arrangements of music, story, pictures, and effects. In the future, I intend to contribute significantly to this.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Now that I've graduated, I'm actively looking for new possibilities. Despite having no professional experience, I created this website to showcase my engine and game programming portfolio. I'm excited to explore new options and see where this journey takes me. If you have any more questions, please contact me via the contact  <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="MenuClick($('#menu-contact'))">contact</a> page.
